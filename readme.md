# Staminaputations

This program takes as input daily records of  past coffee condumption, wake up time, sleep time and sleep duration and sleep quality. 
It performs clustering on different days with affinity propagation algorithm. Once the clustering has been done, it assigns for each new  
day a suggested level of caffeine at sleep time  according to the similatity with existing cluster. It returns whether or not the user should have this next cup 
of coffee.
This program requires: -scikit-learn 0.17
                                          -numpy 1.10.4
                                           -scipy 0.17.0

# Staminaputations: Machine learning for Smarter coffee consumption

# 1. Inputs
This program takes as input daily records of  past coffee condumption, wake up time, sleep time and sleep duration and sleep quality. These data are stored on sever hosted online.
# 2. Functions
Performs clustering on different days with affinity propagation algorithm. Once the clustering has been done, it assigns for each new day a suggested level of caffeine at sleep time  according to the similatity with existing cluster. It returns whether or not the user should have this next cup of coffee.
# 3. Requirements
The following libraries are required:
    
    -numpy 1.10.4
    -scipy 0.17.0
    -scikit-learn 0.17
